      <h1>why our petition to amend the"Skills Visa Act" H.R.2131 is important</h1> 



<div class="row">
              <div class="panel">

                <p><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:h.r.2131:">The current version of the "Skills Visa Act" H.R.2131</a> does not consider the following two categories of E2 Treaty Investors:<br>
                  <ol>
                    <ol>
                      <li class="list-numbers">E2 Treaty Investors who  make substantial capital investments thereby indirectly creating jobs for US workers.</li>
                      <li class="list-numbers">E2 Treaty Investors who legally reside in the US for over 10 years --  starting out under other non-immigrant employment visas prior to changing status to the E2 Treaty Investor program -- and hire less than 5 full-time US workers.</li>
                    </ol>
                                       
                    <p>Our <a href="our-petition-for-amendments-to-skills-visa-act-h.r.2131.html">proposed amendment</a> would accomplish the following:</p>

                    <ol class="list-alphabet">
                      <li class="list-alphabet">The contributions of E2 treaty investors who make <b>substantial investment</b> thereby indirectly creating jobs will be taken into account.</li>
                      <li class="list-alphabet">E2 Treaty Investors who accumulate continuous presence in the US under another non-immigrant employment based visa will  have a path to citizenship after <b>a total of 10 years of lawful presence</b>.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </ol>

                    <p>Our proposed amendment gives the opportunity of permanent residence to E2 Treaty Investors who have been in status for five years and made an investment of no less than $250,000 – in equipment, inventory, premises and storage, patents, trademarks and other that qualifies as a bonafide investment under the current criteria of the E2 Treaty Investor program</p> 

                    <p> Setting the bar to <b>a 10 year minimum under the same E2 status</b> AND at the same time requiring that they retain <b>no fewer than 5 full-time US workers is an unreasonable burden</b> for non-immigrants that have been lawfully present in a status that allows for employment authorization for a continuous period.<br>

                    In the case of H1b visa workers who first spend six years under an H1b visa and later petition a change of status to E2 they would have to wait a total of 16 years for permanent residence. Under these scenarios it would make logical sense to look at cummulative continous years.</p> 

                    <h5>-- even if an E2 Treaty Investor has less than 5 full-time US workers on the payroll, after a decade of lawful presence, would it not be reasonable and beneficial to the US to welcome a tax paying bonafide entrepreneur as a permanent resident?</h5><br>

                    <p>What about E2 Treaty investors who have been in status for 8 years, originally started out with 1 full time employee, later on added 4 more W2 employees and during the 2008-2010 period of economic downturn had to downsize ? Do these entrepreneurs deserve to be excluded from permanent residences because they laid off US workers during times of a US economic crisis and subject to external factors outside of their control? Don’t they deserve the opportunity of permanent residence ? </p> 
                  
                    <p>Quoting Chairman Goodlatte <a href"http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/Markups%202013/mark_06262013/06%2027%2013%20Markup%20Transcript.pdf">(line 69-74, June 27, 2013 markup session House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary)</a>:<br> 

                    "<i>Given the outstanding track record of immigrants in founding some of our most successful companies, how many immigrants do we select on the basis of their entrepreneurial talents? Only a handful, and that is only if they already have the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to participate in the investor visa program."</i></p> 

                    <p>We are grateful for Chairman Goodlatte pointing out that it is not all entrepreneurs who have hundreds of thousands of dollars readily available to invest in someone else's project per EB-5 requirememts. This is very true.<br><br>

                    Please note that as having 5 employees on the payroll at minimum wage (say $8/hour) equals a yearly gross payroll of $104,000, not counting FICA, the current version of the bill would require a payroll of nearly $1,500,000 over a 10 year period.<br><br>

                    A requirement of five full time employees during 10 years, especially in these volatile economic times, would create undue pressure and limit the freedom a business owner needs to run their business according to their personal entrepreneurial style. The value a business brings to job creation and economic contributions may take place in small parts over a long period of time. Slow and steady should not be discouraged if that’s what best for the continuity of the business. <b>Entrepreneurship is not a one size fits all</b>, there are businesses that grow very fast, some grow slow and others that remain small yet last for generations -  they all have their place in the ecosystem and actively contribute to the US economy.</p>

                    <p><i>... "The bill also allocates up to 10,000 green cards a year for alien entrepreneurs who can attract investment from venture capital firms to establish businesses that will create at least 5 jobs <b>or have already created 5 jobs over 10 years through the E-2 treaty investor program</i></b>." <a href"http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/Markups%202013/mark_06262013/06%2027%2013%20Markup%20Transcript.pdf">(line 111-115, June 27, 2013 markup session House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary)</a> </p> 

                    <p>The facebook, google, linkedin, and other myriad of instant and high growth success stories are few and far between compared to the thousands of small and medium businesses and startups that are founded every day and last for many years if not generations. Just like was rightfully pointed out that not all entrepreneurs can have hundreds of thousands of dollars readily available, not all entrepreneurs will need to hire 5 fulltime workers to run sucessfull selfsustaining businesses that make investments in inventory and equipment thereby indirectly creating jobs. Some business models function by making investments in machinery and equipment and use 1099 contractors instead of W2 employees - if that is the better fit for their business model should it not be an option? </p>

                    <h4>We urge Congress to effectively include E2 Treaty Investors who make substantial investments thereby indirectly creating jobs.</h4> <br> 

                    <h4>Similarly we ask for special consideration for long term E2 treaty investors who have been here for a minimum of 10 years. Given their long term status and over a decade of contributions to the United States it would be just make them eligible for a merit based green card.</h4> <br>

                    <p>It can take a long time to learn how to build a business and the upside of experience should not be disregarded 

                      <img src"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=361533357279642&set=a.149311565168490.22760.143594619073518&type=1&theater"></img>

                    <p>A business should be run according to what makes business sense, whether it be directly or indirectly creating employment opportunities.
                    Decisions to make capital investments instead of hiring more full time staff should not be deferred just to please immigration laws. Each business is different – some are labor intensive and others are more reliant on capital investments.</p><br> 
                    <p>We plead with the House of Representatives to please support entrepreneurs be free to run their business according to their own business plan and style.<p/>
